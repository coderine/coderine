- 👋 Hi, I’m @coderine
- 👀 I’m interested in architecting, designing and coding complex projects. In the coding department, I am proficient (rusty though) in c++, java and c#.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and R
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on algorithm intensive support components or projects in the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), contemporarily called smart mobility solutions. 
- 📫 I can be reached at Coderine.Cfg@gmail.com
